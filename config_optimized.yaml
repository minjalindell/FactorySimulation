# YOUR OPTIMIZATION NOTES: 

# ============================================ 

# Change 1: [Lower machine B prosessing time to 5 minutes. In baseline B takes the most time to process and it is the primary bottleneck. 

# When B process time changes from 7 to 5, the throughput increases allowing C to receive work more consistently. Blocking is also reduced. 

# A spends less time waiting because B clears its queue faster. Orders also move faster since the slowest step is now quicker. Machine failtures 

# have less impact because bottleneck is less severe.] 

# 

# Change 2: [Raising both buffers to 15. This reduces delays and improves throughput. Upstream machines don't have to stop when the next machine is busy, so production 

#  should flow more smoothly. Also more work-in-progress can wait in the buffer, keeping downstream machines busy.] 

# 

# Change 3: [Raising storage capacity from 500 to 550. This ensures there are enough parts available even if demand spikes, preventing production stoppages. 

# This prevents unnecessary idle time at the end of the line when output temporaly exceeds shipment rate.] 

# 

# Change 4: [Raising finished storage from 30 to 50. This provides enough storage for completed products so that C can continue producing without waiting.] 

# 

# Expected Impact: [ 

# 1. Throughput increase -> reducing B's processing time and increasing buffers allows more products to be completed per hour. Expected throughput should increase. 

# 2. Reduced lead time -> Faster bottleneck processing and larger buffers reduce waiting times, so orders move through the system more quickly. 

# 3. Lower delay rate -> Larger buffers absorb variability from machine failtures, preventing upstream blocking. The delay rate is expected to be 0. 

# 4. Balanced machine utilization -> B is less overloaded and upstream/downstream machines spend less time idle, leading to smoother production flow. 

# 5. Resiliency improvement -> Increased warehouse and finished storage capacities reduce risk of production stoppages.]
